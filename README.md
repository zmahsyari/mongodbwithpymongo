MongoDB with pymongo (Practice Case)

MongoDB is a document-oriented NoSQL database used for high volume data storage. MongoDB is a database that came into light around the mid-2000s. It falls under the category of a NoSQL database. MongoDB stores data in JSON-like documents, which makes the database very flexible and scalable. Python needs a MongoDB driver to access the MongoDB database. In this practice case, we will use the MongoDB driver, which is PyMongo to manage unstructured databases. What we will do in this practice case this as follows:
1. Create a new collection with the name clean_movies that is the same as the movies collection in the sample_mflix database using the movies_intial collection (projecting_queries pymongo)
2. Validate the collection that has been made with the following parameters:
    a. All documents on clean_movies and movies are the same
    b. Amount of documents on clean_movies and movies are the same
    c. All fields in clean_movies are in the movies
    d. Let's start it.
